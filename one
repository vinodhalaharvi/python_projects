Usage:  sm_ems [options...] <command>
Options:

   --server=<name>         The name of the server.  Also -s.
   --broker=<location>     Alternate Broker location as host:port.
   --system=<nameOrAddr> 
       Specify the name or IP address of the system this alarm is associated
       with.  The event will automatically be associated with this system in
       the ICOI topology.  The system name is canonicalized using host
       name lookups. If the system does not exist in the topology it may
       be created automatically if the -create-system option is specified.
       Also -t.
   --create-system 
       Indicates that the system should automatically be created if it does 
       not exist in the topology.  The class defaults to Node, or use the 
       --element-class option to specify the class name. 
       Also -c.
   --element-class=<className> 
       Class name to be used if the system specified by --system 
       option is not found in the InCharge topology and --create-system 
       is specified.
       Also -e .
   --element-name=<InstanceName> 
       Instance name to be used with --element-class option
       Options provided with --element-class and --element-name will be used
       to create the object. --system should not be used if --element-class and
       --element-name are mentioned.
       is specified.
       Also -v .
   --create-element 
       Indicates that the element-class and element-name should automatically 
       be created if it does not exist in the topology. 
       Also -C.
   --aggregate-element-class=<className> 
       Aggregate Event Class name to be used if you want to generate an Aggregate 
       Also -E .
   --aggregate-element-name=<InstanceName> 
       Aggregate Instance name to be used with --aggregate-element-class option
       Using --aggregate-element-class and --aggregate-element-name Aggregate Event
       will be created.
       Also -V .
   --aggregate-event-name=<aggregate Event Name> 
       Aggregate Event name to be used if you want to generate an Aggregate 
       Also -g .
   --audit=<msg>   
       Optional text to include in the description field of the
       audit log entry created for the action. Note that this
       option is ignored for the add-audit-log command.
       Also -a.
   --traceServer           Enable tracing of server communications.
   --source-event-type=<eventType>
       Optional source event type for notification.  If not specified, no source event
       type will be passed in the notify() call, which will result in the server inserting
       a default value (typically "UNKNOWN") into the SourceEventType attribute.
       This option only works with a server newer than 6.2-SP2.
    -r <count> - Repeat Count.  Run the command <count> times.

Commands: 
   notify <class> <name> <event> <src> <type> <clear-mode> [<attr>=<val> ...]
              Notify an occurrence of the notification identified by
              <class>, <name>, and <event>.

           <src> indicates the name of the application
              generating the notification.  Note that a subsequent
              invocation to clear this notification must specify
              the same value for <src>

           <type> indicates the nature of the event and it
              must have the value 'momentary' or 'durable'. A
              momentary event has meaning only at a specific point
              in time; it has no duration.  An authentication failure
              event is a good example.  A durable event has a duration
              over which the event is active and after which the
              event is no longer active.  An example of a durable
              event is a link failure.

           <clear-mode> indicates the mechanism by which the event
              will be cleared.  This parameter is ignored when the
              type is discrete. The value 'source' indicates that
              the notification will be cleared automatically by the
              source when the event goes away.  A value of <n>
              indicates that the notification should expire in <n>
              seconds. A value of 'none' indicates that the notification
              should not expire and that the source will not generate
              a clear event; this implies that the actual duration of
              the occurrence will not be known.  In this case the
              system clears the event when it is acknowledged.

           <attr>=<val> ... are optional attribute/value
              pairs where <attr> is the attribute name and
              <val> is the value.  These parameters may be used
              to set additional attribute values for the notification
              object. 

   update <class> <name> <event> <attr>=<value> 
       Update one or more the attributes of an event. 

   clear <class> <name> <event> <src> 
       Clear an occurrence of the notification identified by
       <class>, <name>, and <event>.  <source>
       indicates the name of the application generating
       the clear.

   assign <class> <name> <event> <owner>
       Assign ownership of the notification identified by
       <class>, <name>, and <event> to <owner>.

   release <class> <name> <event>
       Release ownership of the notification identified by
       <class>, <name>, and <event>. The caller
       must be the owner of the notification.

   acknowledge <class> <name> <event>
       Acknowledge the notification identified by
       <class>, <name>, and <event>.  The
       caller must be the owner of the notification in
       order to acknowledge it.

   unacknowledge <class> <name> <event> <owner>
       Unacknowledge the notification identified by
       <class>, <name>, and <event>.  The
       caller must be the owner of the notification in
       order to unacknowledge it.

   add-audit-log <class> <instance> <event> <message>
       Add a user note containing <message> to the audit
      log for the notification identified by <class>
      <instance>, and <event>. Note that the --audit will
      be ignored for this option.

   print <class> <name> <event>
      Print the properties including the audit log for the
      notification identified by <class>, <name>, and
      <event>.

   summarize <NL name>  
      Print a summary of all notifications of
      all NL events
